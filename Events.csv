Important - Getting Started:

Galbraith Gravity Racing
 as your team affiliation.  Any issues with USA Cycling are easily fixed by emailing: 
membership@usacycling.org
Your GGR Team membership includes 
discounted
 entry to all six GGR Local Races - you
 still need to register
 for each race - this is how we assign race plate numbers and sign race waivers.
Coaches start training in February depending on the weather.  All other racers will start the GGR spring session the week of 11 March through 30 May 2024.  An 12 week program.  We have an optional week 13 and 14 depending on weather and how the team is feeling!   Registration includes:
Racer jersey
Discounted
 entry fees for all six GGR races.
11 weeks of practice with 6 weeks of local GGR racing (we take breaks for Spring Break)
Race Support at Hubapalooza and NW Cup #1, NW Cup #2, CDC Post Canyon, CDC North Slope and BME Rock Creek.  (all race support is volunteer driven)
Race support and team events through June 15th 2023.
Access to team pits at all races the team attends - and access to team pit equipment and race trailer.
Use of the team huck wagon and team shuttle days.
Fall program will require additional registration.  
Year round access to the team SLACK and Calendar
All trailers wagons, equipment etc are subject to restrictions.  This is a race team - stuff happens so be flexible.
Team discounts from team sponsors.
The goal of the spring session is to practice key skills, build confidence, team cohesion, endurance and experience the fun of racing.  Racers practice for two weeks, then practice/race for six weeks.  During the session we have trips to Spokane for Hubapalooza (not mandatory),  Port Angeles WA for NW Cup #1 & #2 (not mandatory), and take the week off for Spring Break with the exception of Hubapalooza folks.  At the end of the session, try racing the NW Cup Race #2 and/or the first two Cascadia Dirt Cups. Some of the racers will be heading to Rock Creek during the spring to prepare for U.S. National Champs - make the trip and give it a try!  When the session is over - racers head off and complete the races they want to make in the summer.  Let's get GGR to win the NW Cup Overall again in 2024!
Please note:
Dates are weather and safety dependent, changes can and will occur.  We reserve the right to cancel practice/races and makeup dates may not be available.
Specific dates for specific age groups will be posted on the team calendar and on the team SLACK message board.
Nothing is mandatory to attend - racers set their own schedule
All racers must agree to the code of conduct.
GGR is a race team - not a chid care service or full service coaching clinic program.  Everyone is expected to contribute, be flexible, and help the team.  Fees are used to pay insurance, buy equipment, purchase coaching certifications, etc.  This is not fee for service - in other words, we do not offer prorated refunds.
Calendar (age group groups will be moved about based on the racers needs.  We will offer a M-W option and a T-TH option for practices. Racers can mix and match on a limited basis with approval.  Times are based on sunset, but basically start a little after 4:30ish.  Some rides can happen early for smaller kids based on coach availability.  Some Monday rides are not available after NW Cup events.  Groups are made up after registration)

Creating a BIKEREG account when signing for membership will make it easier for signing up to races/clinic etc.  NW Cup also uses BIKEREG, so create an account if you don't already have one - it will save time in the future. 
***Please note - The event title is 'Membership Drive'.  The timeframe for membership is not the term of membership.  Team insurance and membership set to cover the entire year, through Dec 31st, 2023.  The training and riding spring session season is planned to be Feb-May and team membership is through October, but many factors are considered and the riding schedule is not final.
When you join - you will gain electronic access to the team calendar and team SLACK platform - access emails are not automatic, we have to put them in manually, feel free to remind us.
Membership also includes team jersey for the racers, parents need to purchase a jersey if they want one.  Parents are encouraged to race in a team jersey!  We have a specific support group for parents for 'kids that are faster than they are' ;).  Once into SLACK and the Calendar, you will see season training seminars that start early March.  These seminars are the fundamentals racers will practice over and over...  The season is divided into three main parts - Training in the Spring (Spring Session).  Racing in the Summer (NW Cups, Cascadia Enduros, BMEs, Nationals etc).  Taper and fun in the Fall.  If you have questions - please let us know.
Refunds - we have fixed and variable costs. If you change your mind, and need a refund, funds may not be available. Once clinics start, and jerseys have been ordered no refunds for these items will be issued.  
Appreciate your being part of the team!

Dry Hill is always open to the public for pedal-up laps, but only authorized vehicles are allowed past the podium area.  We will be using a van with a Huckwagon trailer set to take 10 riders per lap.  Laps take about 15 minutes round trip, so you can get plenty in a day.




On most days, all trails will be open to ride, and there are quite a few.  You might even make it a goal to ride (find) every trail in a day.  Remember, this is a recreation day not a race day.  Ride within your limits and stay safe.


 




ALWAYS RIDE WITH A BUDDY, HAVE A PHONE, AND THE EMERGENCY CARD!!!!  There are a lot of trails to disperse into and if something happens, we want to get to you as fast as possible.  Safety first!!


There will be a porta-pottie available, but this is the woods, so don't count on electricity or potable water.  Bring snacks, lunch, water and whatever else you need to keep yourself riding for the day.


This is a rider/builder operated business so pretty much all proceeds go back into the trails.

Welcome! The Stage 1 Cycling Club is a registered non-profit cycling organization based in East Hampton, CT. We got our start over 30 years ago here in Connecticut and have gone through many iterations and changes over the years. But one constant remains: STAGE 1 is dedicated first and foremost to having fun, building a community of cyclists where all riders are welcome, and promoting the sport of bicycling across the region. We believe that pretty much everyone is happier on a bike, whether riding or racing on the road, the moutain, on gravel, or snow -- it's all about the fun! 




STAGE 1 is composed of riders of all levels from all walks of life, from beginners to elite racers. If you don’t know how to ride a bike, we’ll teach you. If you’re a national level competitor, we’ll support you and help make you better. Most of all, we want to ride with you. To join STAGE 1, please contact us first through our 
Facebook page
, or drop by AirLine Cycles in East Hampton, CT, so we can talk with you, tell you more about our club, and learn more about you and your goals. Better yet, join us for a ride and lets talk more over pizza and a drink. No race resumes, no secret handshakes - just a good attitude and a desire to ride. If we're the right fit for you, welcome aboard! Just come on back here, and you can complete the registration process. Of course, if you want in now, that's fine too! 




STAGE 1 members receive discounts from our sponsors, and the more committed our riders and members are, the more sponsorship they receive. Unlike many teams, it’s not just about results: it’s about commitment, attitude, and effort. For more details, please visit 
here
.




















STAGE 1 is currently made up of over 100 full members: about 60 seniors, 35 juniors, 20 women and girls (we’d love to see more!); our oldest member is 70 and our youngest is 5. 




We are an active club and we host many cycling events each year.  Obviously 2020/21 were COVID years, but we still managed to put on several COVID-safe events . For 2022, we plan to again host a USA Cycling sanctioned mountain bike race in June, and this fall we can't wait to bring back the Belltown CX race for it's forth year. Of course, we will also hold many training rides, fun rides, and competitive road adventure and gravel rides. And together with AirLine Cycles, we host a Thursday night mountain bike training ride (year around) and Wednesday night gravel ride (during the summer). And, of course, we will continue with our popular junior programs and activities.


What else?  Well, we race a lot! STAGE 1 riders participate in events all over N
ew England and you will also find us competing in the mid-Atlantic, California, and other locations all over the country racing nearly every weekend in the spring, summer, and fall (sometime in the winter too). Although we are heavily mountain and cyclocross focused at the moment, we also compete in road events and multi-sport competition. We proudly sponsor a junior team and we are committed to getting as many kids on bikes as possible!  If you join us and plan to seek a USAC license, please be sure to indicate your club affiliation as STAGE 1 Cycling Club (STAGE 1/AirLine Cycles). You can purchase a race license here: 
https://www.usacycling.org/
.


But plenty of our active members don’t race and that’s fine too. We're glad to hangout and party with all comers! 


We have great sponsors who generously support our club and believe in our mission. They are AirLine Cycles, Fat Orange Cat Brewery, and Pactimo.


Come join us and have some fun!","Club Membership, Club Membership",-72.5024804,41.5758442

Get ready to go FAST on the Rock Hill Velodrome in 2024??
 
We're bringing the fastest and most skilled motor pacing to Rock Hill and it's going to be 
OPEN TO ALL ATHLETES, regardless of your coaching affiliation! 
**SPRINT & ENDURANCE**
Each session is going to be a combination of short (<5km) individual/team efforts and longer (>10min) group efforts. Athletes will need to submit their requested workout/efforts at time of registration and the coach will be in contact to confirm if those efforts will be possible or if modifications will be necessary. Athletes also have the option of mixing in to the pre-scheduled efforts if they wish. 
**SAFETY FIRST**
The single most important rule of these sessions is SAFETY FIRST. All athletes are required to follow the schedule exactly and instructions from the coach(es) immediately. Anyone who cannot follow these instructions or otherwise presents a safety risk, will be immediately asked to leave the session and may be banned from all future BPC motor pacing sessions. 
**ALL SESSIONS ARE PRE-REGISTRATION ONLY!!!!**
There will be absolutely NO day of admittance to any session. Registration closes at 5pm on the Thursday prior to the Sunday session. 
**REGISTRATION FEE ONLY RESERVES YOUR SPOT - This is NOT the full/final fee for the session**
These are private track rentals which are permitted and insured as USA Cycling Events. In order to make these sessions possible athletes can expect a per session fee of $40-$50. Final fee for the session is determined off of workout/efforts per individual. This amount is due before the start of the session and will be communicated from the coach ahead of time.
In the case of cancellation due to weather or any other reason, registration fees will be rolled forward to the next scheduled session. Decisions on cancellation will be made by the Friday prior to the session.","Track, Cycling Camp",-81.0250784,34.9248667

Nerac Earth Cycling Club is a group of mountain and road riders of all levels that ride for pleasure and race for competition. Our base is at Nerac, Inc. in Tolland, CT where our club sponsor Kevin Bouley, Nerac owner and CEO, has reached out and inspired others to get on their bikes and ride, race, and promote cycling at all levels.


Our club was founded in March of 2006 and currently has around 60 members. Our goals are to promote cycling, maintain a positive representation of our sponsors, keep our members active in the cycling community, have fun, and recruit new members to the sport by sharing our enthusiasm.  I wouldn’t describe our club as a race club however we do support our racers and all our riders in all their endeavors. We enjoy bringing our new riders up to speed and helping them improve their skills as much as we enjoy hammering out a fast paced road or mountain bike ride.

Thank you for your interest in the First Century. This ride is presented by Adirondack Ultra Cycling and is part of the 
ADIRONDACK ULTRA CHALLENGE
.
This ride starts promptly at the 
ADIRONDACK ULTRA CYCLING BIKE SHOP
, located at: 160 Broad Street, Schuylerville, NY. Broad Street is the main street in Schuylerville and is also US 4, NY 29 and NY 32. The shop is located on the east side of the road, about halfway between the two traffic lights. Please arrive early enough to give yourself time to park, check in and get ready, so that we may start on time. If this ride has a time limit and/or recorded time, please note that times are recorded ""door to door,"" with all rest stops, mechanical stops, delays, etc., included in your official finish time. The official event clock begins at the advertised start time, whether or not you are actually riding, and all finishing times are recorded when a rider checks in with the official time keeper. If a rider dawdles at their car or changes or packs up before checking in, their time will reflect that, just as if you took a break in the middle of the ride.
If the weather is a little brisk, we'll meet inside the shop. If it's nice out, we'll meet in the backyard. To access the backyard, please use Beagle Lane, which is off Saratoga Street, which is off Broad Street. Please note that there is no parking in the backyard or on Beagle Lane and the shop does not have a parking lot. There is ample parking on the streets in front of and on the side of the shop, but please make sure not to use another business' parking lot, whether or not they are open, or block anyone's driveway or the street itself, as your car may be ticketed or towed if you do. For additional parking, you may also use the parking lot at Fort Hardy Park, which is at the end of Saratoga Street by the river. The shop will be open before and after the ride, in case you need anything or forgot something, and if you would like your bike serviced (or assembled if you are travelling to the start) before this ride, please 
CONTACT US
 as soon as possible to schedule your work.
We are going to use our Triple Loop route, which consists of three scenic and rolling loops along the Hudson River and through Saratoga County, with each loop returning to the shop where riders can take a break, warm up and resupply.

Mountain Cross #1,1/11/25 0:00,1/11/25 0:00,1257 County Farm Rd,Bedford,VA,24523,http://www.BikeReg.com/mtx-1,"WHAT IS Mountain Cross / MTX?
 
The ""Mountain"" part refers to many of the same aspects that you might encounter in a mountain bike race.  There will be single track with rocks, roots, etc that will make up roughly 50% of the course. The other 50% of the course will consist of mixed surfaces such as grass paths, gravel or pavement, and double track dirt roads. 
The ""Cross"" parts refers to the style of racing and variety of terrain the race combines with added elements of mountain biking and cyclocross. There may be barriers, stairs, or other obstacles that riders will have to navigate and as always, good vibes! The races are short, intense, and loads of fun! 
We have professional chip timing to get fast and reliable results! Beginners have 30 minutes to do as many laps as they can while the sport have 45 minutes and the experts have 60 minutes. We hold the tradition of letting people go out for the bonus lap if they make it in the timing zone before the clock hits 0! The winner is the person who does the most laps in the least amount of time. 
Timing is being handled by Jeremy Ramsey with MMG Endurance Sports! 
He host's some great cycling events like the Buffalo River Gran Fondo, the Wormhole, SOTR, and other races so be sure to check them out and support! 
https://www.mmgendurancesports.com/
This race embodies the Norwegian proverb that says, ""There is no bad weather, only poor clothing choice.""

Rated 4.5/5 stars on the Reuter Scale
Please step away from your trainers, exit Wattopia, put on your long johns, and come race bikes and see friends IRL! 
BE SURE TO PREREGISTER SO WE KNOW HOW MUCH FOOD TO GET
Registration is open through the event, but if you show up day of, we will heckle you extra for not registering early.
So what the heck is Fatty Cross? 
The Fatty Cross Race Series is a three-event winter adventure race series held at the Haddam Neck Fairgrounds.  The timed races will be held on a cyclocross-style course, with A, B, and junior race categories, followed by a fat-bikes only race at the end of the day.  Weather happens, and these races will be rain or shine or snow, so choose your bike and clothing carefully!
Our intent is to host a FUN event to bridge the downtime between CX and MTB seasons, get people off their trainers, and hopefully have people show up at the 10AM start of the day and stay through the end, yet still be back in the cars headed home by 2PM.  We'll have warming tents, hot beverages available, a big honking bonfire, and a fun course where hand-ups and malarkey are welcomed. We are drawing heavily upon all the favorite races in New England, and aiming to have that sort of bike party… thanks to the fine folks behind Ice Weasels, Secret Squirrel, and other great local races for the ideas and inspiration!
 
In the spirit of keeping things local, we are psyched to be sponsored by Massachusetts-based Endurance Threads for all the prizes!  Endurance Threads will also be on hand to sell some merch as well, and we'll scrounge up some other great LOCAL prizes to reward your efforts.  
 
RACE DETAILS
Bring yourself, your CX rig or mountain bike (no bar ends!), a FAT BIKE, and - of course - bring lots of friends to heckle you. We'll provide a great course, solid competition, fabulous prizes, bumpin' tunes, and (most of all) good times! See you there!
  
Just a couple of things to note about the event:
1.   Please register in advance. We need to know how many port-o-potties to rent, how much food to bring, etc, and last minute registrations really make life hard for promoters… and if you're one of those “wait until the last possible second to register…and then complain about not enough port-o-potties” folks, please give that some careful reflection.   With that said, if you need to cancel your registration because of illness, family situation, etc, please just reach out and we'll be happy to move your registration to another event or provide a refund.   
2.  Hand-ups are allowed and encouraged.  (don't know what a hand-up is?  click here: 
https://velorosacycling.com/blogs/news/the-art-of-the-handup
)
3.  Pre-riding the course will be allowed in between the races, but the course will not be accessible in the days before the event.  Pre-riding during the active racing will NOT be allowed.   
4.  This is a lower cost, unsanctioned race.  Adjust your expectations accordingly. This event is all about winter fun on bikes!  Yes, our prices went up from last year, but due to unpredictability of weather and registration, and the fact that we provide a ton of food each week, we thought this made sense.  We aren't trying to make money off of this, so if in Week 3, we have a surplus, we'll pass it on to the community via cheap/free reg for some categories, prizes, or additional food.  We'd rather be able to pay the plow guy than have to cancel a race if we get some snow.
5.  Podiums in the A, B, Fat Bike, and Junior races will have separate podiums for men and women.
6.  Individual races: $35 adults, $30 juniors.  Series pass: $90 adults, $75 juniors 
Race in a second category for only $10 (Additional Series Pass: $25) 
(if you should be an A, please don't sandbag and race in the B's or we will heckle you mercilessly and make you race on a klunker)
7
. 
Race dates: January 12, January 26, and February 9th
If weather is dangerous, we will choose an alternate date. 
8.  Non-binary athletes are warmly welcomed.  If you love to ride and race bikes, that's all we need to know, and we'd love to have you take part in our race. If you have ideas, suggestions, or requests, please reach out to brian@airlinecycles.com.  You are welcome and we'd love to have you at this event and all Stage 1/AirLine Cycles events. 
9.  Juniors wanting to race in the fat bike race can use the code JRFATBIKE (JRFATBIKESERIES if you want to race the whole series) to lower the cost to match the junior race.  If you are not a junior and use the code, we reserve the right to kick you out of the race, keep your money, and tell you not to be a big meanie.  Juniors wishing to race in the B race will not be allowed to start any further forward than the 3rd row.
10.  Interested in volunteering or sponsoring FattyCross or have ideas as to how we can make it better.  Let us know via email!

There will be some grass, some trail, some obstacles.  Probably a CX or Hardtail MTB, but you do you.  Its definitely going to be a short-track-ish event with plenty of spectator friendly spots, lap times shorter than 4 minutes, etc.

Snow/Weather
You ought to know by now that mother nature beats the the sound of her own drum. We have no control over snow. We do know that we will run these things come hell or high water and will have fun doing it. If you are a conditions dependent type of rider......well, you might consider just riding the trainer instead. We've raced in blizzards, sub zero temps, warm temps, and soft snow. Thats just how it goes. We make no claims or guarantees on snow conditions, and or trail conditions that are a direct result of snow temps. 
Why
The first time I borrowed a fat bike and rode it down the local cross country ski trails in the snow, a whole new world was opened up! Trail riding was fun and I could stick with it all year ‘round. And, if I could get outside and get my heart rate up, I wouldn’t have to go to the boring old gym I told myself. We put on these races as a way to introduce new people to the world of fat bikes and create a community of riders!
 
Proceeds
We are not a non-profit, but race proceeds will go towards keeping up with grooming some of our local trails, bringing fun events, and supporting new experiences. 
 
Common Questions:
What kind of bike do I need to participate??
 You must ride a fat bike at this event – 3.8"" or bigger tires. ·
What if I don’t own a fat bike?
 Trail Labs will be offering their rental fleets to reserve all winter: visit, email, or call for rental options.
Is it timed? 
The races are indeed timed and results will be posted. Awards (no prizes, no cash) will be classy and cheap.
What is the race length? 
  This will be a lap race with approximately 3-4 laps (10-12 miles) and feature the Meshach Browning Trail system. The exact course and the length of time you can expect to be out racing or riding will be based on conditions and weather on race week and race day.  
What if I am not the “racer” type? 
Not a problem – feel free to enter anyway. Think of it as a chance to ride kick ass groomed trails with new friends! ·One lap, two, or three….no big deal. 
What about the weather? 
This years races can happen in all weather. Chances are good for snow on these dates, but if there is no snow we may adjust courses as necessary. We are hardy Appalachians and will ride no matter the condition...unless it's just stupid out. Stay tuned to your email and social media as the event approaches. 
So how do I stay warm?
 Dress appropriately in layers, ready for temps that can be below zero. Watch the weather. If your feet get too cold, walk. 
Walk to the side of the groomed trails.
 If you walk on the groomed trails it screws up the surface, so be respectful and walk off the edge! . Be prepared, I don't suffer fools. ·Need more info? Come to our clinic weekend on December 2, its free so there's no excuses. 
What if I register but can’t ride??
 We will miss you but, sorry, Registration fees are non-refundable. Registration can be transferred through your bikereg profile. If 
we
 cancel the event, your entry will be refunded.","Fat Bike, Mountain Bike",-79.3528174,39.5584217

The event showcases the diversity of the Maricopa Trail and supports the Maricopa Trail and Park Foundation. Aggressive ascents and descents, grinding it out on the flats, rocks, water, sand, mud, and roller coaster runs are all part of the fun of this challenging course.
Besides being a challenging, exciting, fun race, why does the Prickly Pedal exist? To pour every dollar of race revenue into efforts that will add more pristine miles of Maricopa Trail for riders to enjoy. MT+PF envisions this event evolving into a world class, multi-day, endurance stage mountain bike race, drawing thousands of fans to the desert southwest.
The ride features numerous short, steep, rocky climbs and descents…some of which will require you to dismount and hike. This is not a race for the inexperienced – finish times for most racers are estimated at 3-4 hours. Be prepared for a long day in the saddle. 
This is a tough mountain bike race. 
Camping at Lake Pleasant
We have reserved two of the group camping sites just down the road from the finish line at Lane 10 Boat Ramp. Camping info is below.
No hook ups for Rv’s, however RV’s are welcome in the area. (Dump station is across the way). Tents and vehicle camping is ok.

Water and 110 amp electricity is available, however is shared (these are located at the picnic ramada’s).
Flushable Restrooms and Showers are located in both areas, however will be shared with all group campers, including the 3rd group site which is not our racers.
There will be limited distance between campers, this will be based on the total number of campers. We do have a overflow area also reserved should we reach capacity.
We will assign camping spaces based on how many and what type of units make reservations. We will communicate these assignments during race week.
Camping Fee is $22.00 per night per unit. (A unit is whatever is used to sleep in, this would include a sleeping bag on the ground, tent, vehicle or RV). You can purchase a camping space on the merchandise page.

This is only for the Group Campground area, if you are wanting to camp in any of the other site within the park (Desert Tortoise, Roadrunner), you will need to make those reservations directly with the park.",Mountain Bike,-111.950833,33.8333333

What is a roller race?
250m all-out sprint on fixed gear bikes attached to steel bases
Simple head-to-head race. Winner moves on to next round
Times range from 15sec to 20sec
Once a rider gets up to speed, it becomes a race to see who has the fastest legs, not necessarily the strongest muscles
We remove the front wheel and bolt the bikes to the rollers, no need to balance

Rated 4.5/5 ? on the Reuter Scale
Please step away from your trainers, exit Wattopia, put on your long johns, and come race bikes and see friends IRL! 
BE SURE TO PREREGISTER SO WE KNOW HOW MUCH FOOD TO GET
Registration is open through the event, but if you show up day of, we will heckle you extra for not registering early.
 
So what the heck is Fatty Cross? 
The Fatty Cross Race Series is a three-event winter adventure race series held at the Haddam Neck Fairgrounds.  The timed races will be held on a cyclocross-style course, with A, B, and junior race categories, followed by a fat-bikes only race at the end of the day.  Weather happens, and these races will be rain or shine or snow, so choose your bike and clothing carefully!
Our intent is to host a FUN event to bridge the downtime between CX and MTB seasons, get people off their trainers, and hopefully have people show up at the 10AM start of the day and stay through the end, yet still be back in the cars headed home by 2PM.  We'll have warming tents, hot beverages available, a big honking bonfire, and a fun course where hand-ups and malarkey are welcomed. We are drawing heavily upon all the favorite races in New England, and aiming to have that sort of bike party… thanks to the fine folks behind Ice Weasels, Secret Squirrel, and other great local races for the ideas and inspiration!
 
In the spirit of keeping things local, we are psyched to be sponsored by Massachusetts-based Endurance Threads for all the prizes!  Endurance Threads will also be on hand to sell some merch as well, and we'll scrounge up some other great LOCAL prizes to reward your efforts.  
RACE DETAILS
Bring yourself, your CX rig or mountain bike (no bar ends!), a FAT BIKE, and - of course - bring lots of friends to heckle you. We'll provide a great course, solid competition, fabulous prizes, bumpin' tunes, and (most of all) good times! See you there!
  
Just a couple of things to note about the event:
1.   Please register in advance. We need to know how many port-o-potties to rent, how much food to bring, etc, and last minute registrations really make life hard for promoters… and if you're one of those “wait until the last possible second to register…and then complain about not enough port-o-potties” folks, please give that some careful reflection.   With that said, if you need to cancel your registration because of illness, family situation, etc, please just reach out and we'll be happy to move your registration to another event or provide a refund.   
2.  Hand-ups are allowed and encouraged.  (don't know what a hand-up is?  click here: 
https://velorosacycling.com/blogs/news/the-art-of-the-handup
)
3.  Pre-riding the course will be allowed in between the races, but the course will not be accessible in the days before the event.  Pre-riding during the active racing will NOT be allowed.   
4.  This is a low cost, unsanctioned race.  Adjust your expectations accordingly. This event is all about winter fun on bikes!
5.  Podiums in the A, B, Fat Bike, and Junior races will have separate podiums for men and women.
6.  Individual races: $30 adults, $20 juniors.  Series pass: $75 adults, $50 juniors 
Race in a second category for only $5 (Additional Series Pass: $15) 
(if you should be an A, please don't sandbag and race in the B's or we will heckle you mercilessly and make you race on a klunker)
7
. 
Race dates: January 12, January 26, and February 9th
If weather is dangerous, we will choose an alternate date. 
8.  Non-binary athletes are warmly welcomed.  If you love to ride and race bikes, that's all we need to know, and we'd love to have you take part in our race. If you have ideas, suggestions, or requests, please reach out to brian@airlinecycles.com.  You are welcome and we'd love to have you at this event and all Stage 1/AirLine Cycles events. 
9.  Juniors wanting to race in the fat bike race can use the code JRFATBIKE (JRFATBIKESERIES if you want to race the whole series) to lower the cost to match the junior race.  If you are not a junior and use the code, we reserve the right to kick you out of the race, keep your money, and tell you not to be a big meanie.  Juniors wishing to race in the B race will not be allowed to start any further forward than the 3rd row.
10.  Interested in volunteering or sponsoring FattyCross or have ideas as to how we can make it better.  Let us know via email!

2023 Event POV from Jeremiah Bishop: 
 
 
Event Sponsors:
 
 
 
 
Snow/Weather
You ought to know by now that mother nature beats the the sound of her own drum. We have no control over snow. We do know that we will run these things come hell or high water (despite what happened the other year) and will have fun doing it. If you are a condition dependent type of rider......well, you might consider just riding the trainer instead. We've raced in blizzards, sub zero temps, warm temps, and soft snow. Thats just how it goes. We make no claims or garuntees on snow conditions, and or trail conditions that are a direct result of snow temps. 
Why
The first time I borrowed a fat bike and rode it down double trouble (a local trail), I was sold on just what  fat bikes are for and that they are here to stay. I bought one the next day. We put on these races as a central way to pump up fat bike stoke around these parts.
 
Proceeds
We are not a non-profit, but race proceeds will go towards keeping up with grooming some of our local trails. Check out the 
Locations
 that we are grooming for the 2024/2025 season.
 
Common Questions:
What kind of bike do I need to participate??
 You must ride a fat bike at this event – 3.8"" or bigger tires. ·
What if I don’t own a fat bike?
 Trail Labs will be offering their rental fleets to reserve all winter: visit, email, or call for rental options.
Is it timed? 
The races are indeed timed and results will be posted. Awards (no prizes, no cash) will be classy and cheap.
What is the race length? 
  We are calling this one a 50k. No, it won't be exactly 50k, but it will be in the ballpark. It will be a lap race with approximately 3-4 laps and feature promised land trail predominantly. Also, the exact course and the length of time you can expect to be out racing or riding will be based on conditions and weather on race week and race day.  
What if I am not the “racer” type? 
Not a problem – feel free to enter anyway. Think of it as a chance to ride kick ass groomed trails with new friends! ·One lap, two, or three….no big deal. 
What about the weather? 
This years races can happen in all weather option. Chances are good for snow on these dates, but if there is no snow we may adjust courses as necessary. We are hardy West Virginians and will ride no matter the condition...unless it's just stupid out. Stay tuned to your email and social media as the event approaches. 
So how do I stay warm?
 Dress appropriately in layers, ready for temps that can be below zero. Watch the weather. If your feet get too cold, walk. 
Walk to the side of the groomed trails.
 If you walk on the groomed trails it screws up the surface, so be respectful and walk off the edge! . Be prepared, I don't suffer fools. ·Need more info? Come to our clinic weekend, its free so there's no excuses. 
What if I register but can’t ride??
 We will miss you but, sorry, Registration fees are non-refundable. Registration can be transferred through your bikereg profile. If 
we
 cancel the event, your entry will be refunded.","Fat Bike, Mountain Bike",-79.4647632,39.1287273

The event will be held on a Sunday morning in Downtown Stillwater. It will have a large window of time during the day to self-space and complete the course (more than once if you choose). Participants can either ‘ride’ or ‘race’ the course; but for the racers…  the 3 designated timed racing segments along the course being the only portions that should be raced! There is no prize for the fastest completion of the entire course! Both fat-bikes and mountain bikes will be allowed, but should the course be soft, fat bikes may be your only rideable choice!
This event in the past has been made possible by several primary sponsors, and discount coupons offered by other local downtown businesses. We will be seeking this again... to be announced soon. THANK YOU.
Event Schedule and Details:
Dates/Times
: Sunday 26th January 2025. Earliest start is 10am, and all need to finish by 2pm.
Location/Course
: (
https://ridewithgps.com/routes/48970283
) Starting and finishing at River Siren Brewing, 225 Main St N, Stillwater MN 55082, with an outside deck (weather permitting), or inside fireplace (weather forbidding), both of which oversee the start-finish on the Loop Trail. The brewery is not typically open at this time, but they are opening early to accommodate us. Riders ride the trail, then turn left (east) on the St Croix Crossings Bike Loop Trail, crossing the St Croix River on the old lift bridge, up the 0.5 mile 8% Houlton Hill and winding back into into Oak Park Heights via the new spectacular Hwy 36/64 bridge, onto (or bi-pass) the groomed single-track mountain bike trails at Valley View Park, returning into Stillwater paralleling the St Croix River on the west side of the St Croix Crossings Bike Loop Trail, then finally the south section of the Brown’s Creek Trail. Participants can choose to 'ride' the entire 10-mile course (including the Houlton Hill 0.5 mile) segment, or by-pass the 2 technical 'racing' segments in Valley View Park (1.2 miles & 1.7 miles) shortening their course to 7.1 miles.
Parking
: The brewery is giving us exclusive use of their private parking lot (20 spaces) immediately north of their building, until Noon. But there are plenty of parking spaces on Sunday mornings in the winter on streets and in many surrounding parking lots.
Racers
: The timed segments will be tracked using Ride with GPS’ app. Rides must be tracked and/or downloaded onto Ride with GPS within 1 day following completion of the ride. The course may be ‘ridden’ or 'raced' as many times as each participant wants during the event day at no additional cost, but racing segments must be completed in order, and as a part of each 10-mile complete course.
Registration Fees
:
 
Adults (19+) $25.00, Youth (18-) $15.00. It is not recommended that children (11-) attempt this ride. Pre-registration is strongly encouraged (COVID recommendation), and fees will increase to $30 and $20 respectively for onsite/day-of registrations. No refunds.
Beneficiaries

 but has a bit of a spring classics feel because of the weather and general road conditions this time of year.  A road or gravel bike will be the ideal mode of transportation.  You can check out last year's loop here:  
https://www.strava.com/activities/8782628772
 
Depending on your fitness level, and how many goodies you consume at the sugar shacks, the 60 mile participants should expect to be out anywhere from 3-6 hours.  There will be a short loop option as well.  Exact distance tbd, but it should be around 30 miles for anyone looking for a bit less challenge.  This loop only has one big climb, but dishes out just shy of 100' per mile of climbing to help you build your early season base!  
All registered participants will receive a gpx file and a cue sheet (both via e-mail) for both loops.  This ride is a go rain or shine!  In the off chance of extremely inclement weather forcing us to cancel, registered riders will have the option to defer to next year's ride, transfer the registration to the Fon Solo gravel ride in the fall or to donate the funds to the Schmid Preserve. 
All proceeds go to support the Schmid Preserve in Edgecomb.

WEATHER PROTOCOL: 
The event is held rain-snow-or-shine. Organizers reserve the right to shorten the route due to extremely foul weather. Rain bag service available for Epic, Endeavor and Explorer categories. (See below for details.) 
ENTRY DEFERMENT POLICY:

Entries may only be deferred one time. The deadline to do so is 11:59 p.m. on Monday, March 17. To request a deferment and/or transfer send email to admin@DomestiqueEvents.com. 
INSURANCE SURCHARGE.  
A rider's entry includes a $5.99 surcharge to pay for USA Cycling's insurance underwriter. (Hence, our fee increase.) 
WAITLIST POLICY: THE TOTAL CAPACITY OF THIS RIDE IS 900 AND IS EXPECTED TO SELL OUT. 
Organizers studied registration history to determine field limits in each category. Field limits in each category will be observed until February 1 when organizers may then adjust the the limits based on rider demand and waitlists. On Wednesday, March 19 organizers will “re-balance” the field limits to allow riders on the waitlist to participate in categories with open slots while respecting the total capacity of the event.

Same-day registration will be available for open categories. There will be a $15 additional fee for day-of registration.

START PROTOCOL. 
There will be a mass start for each category for which flaggers will provide guidance for ONLY the first six miles. Riders may start on their own during the 20 minute period after the designated start time.

The Waucheesi Bike Event is wickedly sweet and includes three distances: the Wily 88, the Wondrous 63, and the 45, crafted by Chris Joice.
Make no mistake, this event is just as challenging as it is beautiful. Cherohala Skyway, Cherokee and Nantahala National Forests provide all the goods—long climbs, fast descents, great forest roads, rowdy gravel, and amazing vistas. If you dare to try the 88-mile option, you’re looking at a stout 11,500+ feet of climbing, while the 63-mile course is no joke, with 8,800+ feet. Both routes include the Basin Gap and North River Road climbs, while the 88-mile course adds a spectacular climb to Farr Gap. Prizes will be given to the top three in each category for each distance.
For those not interested in biting off the longer distances, we have a 45-mile ride option. The 45-mile course offers a great tour of Cherokee National Forest and Bald River, while climbing 4,100 feet. Please note prizes will not be given out for this distance.
Riders must be finished by sunset. Therefore, we have the following time requirements for the 63 and 88 mile distances: 
Must reach the 24-mile split by 1pm or you will have to take the 45-mile route.
Must reach 45-mile split by 2:30pm or you will have to take the 63-mile route.
If you are completing the 88-mile course, you must have lights at rest stop 4 after 6pm.

 would like to invite women/girls to ride on Tuesday nights in April at the Farmall Hill 
Mountain Bike C
hallenge course.
This series is not a race.
 Our goal is to create a welcoming and non-intimidating environment for all girls/women who want to challenge their mountain bike skills and have fun riding.  We are asking for a one time fee of $10 to help with porta-potty and insurance cost. Registration and signed waiver is required to attend. 
Event Dates:      April 1, April 8, April 15, April 22.  (April 22nd only will overlap with the 
Farmall Hill Mountain Bike Challenge
 pre-ride. Riders who have pre-registered for the 
FHMBC race
 will be in attendance to pre-ride the course.)
Time:  Please arrive by 5:45pm for check-in. Rides depart at 6pm.
These are no-drop group rides.
  Lets face any challenges and develop confidence together. Depending on turnout we can break up into multiple groups based on skill, friends, bike color, or dance moves.
Be aware, 
this course has many steep hills
 and may challenge your fitness.  Mountain bikes with good climbing gears and strong brakes are best for this course.  
Helmets are a must at all times
.
We are open to women that have a mountain bike and already know how to use their brakes, shift gears, and are able to stand while pedaling. 
 
Before arriving:
 Please make sure your bike is in good working order. Good brakes are a must on these hills. Consider taking your bike to 
RV&E for service
 and maintenance before riding.  
Here's a video of a race that took place on the course to give you an idea of what you'll be riding on.

Starting and ending on the famed LBJ Ranch
, the routes take riders under majestic live oaks, past historical landmarks that figured prominently not only in the Johnson family history but also in U.S. presidential history. See the descendants of President Johnson's famed Hereford cattle herd as you exit the Ranch. Thereafter, it's on to spectacular Hill Country cycling – on smooth-surfaced ranch-market roads and bucolic country lanes that will take you back in time. Visit rural, historic Gillespie County schools that do duty as rest stops on this scenic tour. This is truly a ""
Ride to Preserve History
."" Proceeds benefit three key areas at the LBJ National Historical Park - education, preservation, and restoration.
Our 36th President loved his ranch. He often conducted presidential business under the spreading oak trees, and he sought solace here from the rigors of the presidency.
As President Johnson told visitors to his beloved Hill Country ranch, ""All the world is welcome here!"" We want riders in the LBJ 100 Bicycle Tour to feel the same warm welcome and sense of Presidential history as those who came before them.
Mandatory Pick Up Rule for Routes 30-62 mile
: The LBJ Ranch closes at 5 PM.  To ensure that all cyclists have returned to the start/finish line by 4 PM the following mandatory pick up rule applies:  Cyclists traveling the 30 & 42-mile routes must have reached Rest Stop #9, located at Nebgen School, by 1 PM in order to continue the ride.  Cyclists traveling the 62-mile route must have reached Rest Stop #7, located at the intersection of FM 1320 and FM 2721, by 2 PM in order to continue the ride.  LBJ 100 administrators and partners will travel the routes from the rest stops backwards to pick up cyclists and provide transportation for cyclists back to the LBJ Ranch.
If severe weather is a possibility, ride organizers will make a call by 5:00 PM on Friday, April 4, to hold the ride or to cancel it. Updates will be posted on the ride website and social media.

The UDR is a completely unsupported gravel adventure consisting of a 70 mile loop. The 70 mile loop has two 35 mile legs. Riders may start in Madison or Matfield Green.  Note if you are only riding one direction, half the distance, you must arrange your own transport back to your vehicle.
Exact parking and starting locations will be made known closer to the ride. Keep in mind Matfield Green has extremely limited resources. I am considering setting up a basic hydration station for the turn around.","Gravel, Gravel",-96.135829,38.1355772

This is not for the faint of heart; it's a proper Ozark backcountry experience. Forest Service and County roads get ROWDY. A hardtail mountain bike with 2.2"" tires or bigger is the general recommendation. If you're a fan of underbiking, you won't be stopped but you've been warned. 
Resupply runouts are one of the most notable challenges of this event. A combo of limited store hours and tiny “towns” take the logistics to a heightened level. 
Below are the tentative routes. Changes will be minor if any - water levels can attribute to this. Expect some water crossings no matter what.

We blocked off cabins Friday, Saturday and Sunday night for this event so you'll have to call to make a reservation. Just mention you're participating in Doom and they'll let you book anything that's still available! Camping is first come, first serve - but they won't run out of space. They're actively working on an additional campground that will have reservable sites as well (2025 TBD). Horseshoe Canyon Ranch day rates, meal pricing, and other amenities & activities can be found via the link below.

Doom & Despair riders will be required to carry a tracking device and register via Trackleaders (this happens closer to the event) so please be aware an additional cost will come up apart from this event registration. Renting ends up being around $80 and providing your own ends up being around $30. 
Doom & Despair riders get 
gremlin bells 
the morning of the event. These have to be attached to the bike in some form or fashion throughout the ride. 
Dismay was added to get more people in on the party! Tracking is optional. 
Full refunds available before March 1st, 2025; no refunds after that. You may transfer your registration to someone else or you can defer as credit to a future event.

Despair & Dismay riders will be able to sleep in the backyard of an airbnb being rented in Oark for night one and use the facilities in the house (running water, toilet, etc.). If you need to be picked up on route it is your responsibility to figure it out. If it's an emergency, we will treat it as an emergency.","Mountain Bike, Gravel",-93.1865659,36.0081324

The Appalachian Journey,4/5/25 0:00,4/5/25 0:00, 2697 Franklin Pike SE,Floyd,VA,24091,http://www.BikeReg.com/the-appalachian-journey,"First things first make sure to follow The Appalachian Journey on 
Facebook
 and 
Instagram
. We will be sharing lots of content there to help inform and prepare all our participants over the next several months. 
Note that we have begun a 
phased pricing plan
 because of the complexities and costs of organizing last minute support for additional riders. Original pricing Nov 3rd to Jan 1. Second phase Jan 1 to Feb 28. Final phase March 1 to April 4th.
The Idea: 
The idea for The Journey comes from a fundamental wish to share our favorite riding experiences with our friends and with the world. Floyd County has tremendous dirt, primitive, and gravel road resources to allow riders to challenge themselves as much as they like. Floyd County; known as the ""Center of the Universe,"" has a special vibe which we know will foster a unique cycling experience for all of us the weekend of The Journey.
The Format
: We have chosen to launch The Journey as a partner format event. Call it a race if you'd like, call it an experience if you will. The event will be professionally timed and podiums will be held. Duo racing is more common as a mountain bike stage race format at events like the Cape Epic or The Pioneer where partners coordinate as a team to go faster, farther, and harder than they would be able to as solo riders. The Duo format requires partnership and communication and produces a tremendously enriching experience for both participants. This comes from our belief that the best rides happen with friends. Fast or slow its all about The Journey.
Riders in a team compete side by side together with times taken at each checkpoint to ensure riders stay within 5 minutes of each other. Time for the team is taken a the second rider to cross the finish line. Riders are often faster together than they would be independently if they work together. Partners are encouraged to assist each other by any ""non-mechanical"" means. This means pushing, pulling, ""throws"" or other partner format assistance is acceptable but tethers, ropes, or other ""mechanical means"" are not permitted. 
The Journey will be 4 distances: 35,70, 100, and 149 miles with each featuring around 100 feet/mile of elevation. This year we feature NEW courses which move South to cover fresh ground towards Rocky Knob and Buffalo Mountain, circumnavigating The Buffalo and returning using Blue Ridge Parkway features. 
Please Note: Distances are subject to change pending permitting and conditions.
NEW distance, the County Traverse. This distance is limited to qualified teams who have what it takes to complete this unsupported gravel adventure. Lights and self-reliance required. There are multiple opportunities for resupply on course. This route circumnavigates Floyd County using majority dirt roads and unique features we couldnt get to without this length of route. Category is closed but wait list is opened. Register using the wait list and we will reach out to approve your participation in The County Traverse.
Each distance will have fully supported aid stations and medical along the route. We don't want a bonk or a bruise to get in the way of your Journey. 
A note on finishing distances - Say you bit off more than you can chew. If you choose to finish a shorter distance despite being registered for a longer doggie then you can choose to complete a shorter distance and will be scored in the ""non-competitive"" category with posted time.

 You'll find the

There are many Air BNB or traditional lodging options very close to the venue as well. We will host packet pickup Friday night the 1st at the world famous Floyd Co Jamboree where you'll be treated to a special Bluegrass experience.
We know things happen. Refunds issued up to 30 days prior to the event, Vouchers for another the following year's Journey or The Appalachian Mountaineer will be given after 30 days. Riders can adjust distances or edit entries online however no changes can be made less than 72 hours out.

RVA Racing’s “No Risk Registration Policy”
RVA Racing is the only race promoter who offers a “no-risk registration policy” to all our pre-registered racers.
There is a lot of planning that goes into running our events. We have worked hard to find venues that complement the RVA Racing Events philosophy of what racing MTBs is all about.
As such, we do our best to plan our Series Races in venues that can run rain or shine. Canceling a race is never easy on us, the host, or the racer. We want to keep you safe while not tearing up the trails or your gear.
Why
? we want you to register early so we can do our part to run an amazing event. We also understand that schedules change, and life/family stuff happens - we’ve got your back!
Here’s how it works:
If 
YOU
 cannot make the race, email us NO LATER THAN TWO-DAYS BEFORE the event at 
info@rvaracing.com
 and let us know. RVA Racing will offer you the choice of either a refund or credit for the full amount of your registration fees.
If 
WE
 need to cancel the race, RVA Racing will offer you the choice of either a refund or credit for the full amount of your registration fees.
If 
WE
 need to postpone or reschedule the race, RVA Racing will automatically transfer your entry fee to the rescheduled date. In the case that the new date does not work for you, email us NO LATER THAN TWO-DAYS BEFORE the event at 
info@rvaracing.com
 and let us know. RVA Racing will offer you the choice of either a refund or credit for the full amount of your registration fees.
YOU
 are 
not eligible
 if you notify us on or after race day.
In ALL cases, credits are good for any RVA Racing Events race or merchandise in the current year and for the next 2 years.","Mountain Bike, Commonwealth Championship Series",-78.26150372,37.8647
Blue Ridge Extreme Gravel,4/5/25 0:00,4/5/25 0:00,273 Mayo Dr,St George,VA,22935,http://www.BikeReg.com/blue-ridge-extreme-gravel,"The Blue Ridge Extreme Gravel (BREG) ride is a very unique event which will test the strength and skill limits of most gravel riders and also push the limitations of their bikes.  This ride starts and finishes at the Blue Ridge School in beautiful St. George VA about 30 minutes northwest of Charlottesville. The most unique component of BREG is the ride begins and finishes with a couple miles of smooth  “gravel bike friendly” single track. Sandwiched in between this fun single track riding experience will be some intense and technical gravel riding in the Blue Ridge Mountains. There will be long climbs on unpaved roads with VERY steep grades and a few unpaved descents that will definitely challenge the skills of even the most seasoned gravel bike riders. However, there will also be sections of gravel on gently rolling terrain in the beautiful foothills of the mountains. In short the BREG will offer everything from one extreme to the other! The gravel routes will have a rest stop with food, drink and mechanical support at miles 22 and 39 and a post ride meal will be provided.
NOTE: This event is not recommended for novice gravel riders and is not suitable for road bikes with wider tires. Gravel specific bikes with tires widths of 35mm or greater are highly recommended. Mountain bikes could be used for any of the BREG routes. 
PLEASE NOTE: To eliminate known issues regarding tampering, destruction and removal of bike-route directional signage, there will be NO directional signage placed on the routes once exiting the Blue Ridge School property. Please take notice that it will be your responsibility to navigate your route once exiting the school property. Below are links to ride maps for all the routes. These links will allow for exporting the appropriate navigational files to your device or phone. For those that don’t have a navigational device, Komoot is an excellent free phone App that will provide GPS routing with audible voice commands once navigation files are loaded. If you don’t have either a device or phone please follow another rider who does, or request a clue sheet at rider check-in. Please prepare yourself for successful navigation.  Remember this is NOT a race. Your patience and understanding while navigating the route is greatly appreciated!

The Mix Tape,4/6/25 0:00,4/6/25 0:00,443 Old Fall River Rd,Dartmouth,MA,2747,http://www.BikeReg.com/themixtape,"You Gotta Fight For Your Right to Party
 
Meet The Mix Tape.  It's not a gravel ride.  It's not a road ride.  It's not a mountain bike ride.  It's not a gran fondo.  It's not a race.  Well it is a race... if you want it to be a race.  But you don't have to race.  But you can totally race.  So, it's kind of a gran fondo.
The Mix Tape is our answer to the lack of something different down our way.  We wanted something that's as challenging as you want to make it with a little bit of everything.  Since we don't have many hills we had to get creative.  So we designed you a 50-60 mile rolling party that covers pavement, light trails, fire roads, a little singletrack, and some challenging tech that's brief but impactful.  What all of this means is that there's no perfect bike for this.  On the roads you'll hate your mountain bike and when you're climbing The Ledge you'll be wishing you had it.  So we feel that the perfect bike for this is the one with drop bars and the biggest tires that fit.  But you decide what works for you.  Just don't bring your road bike.  You won't get far and you will hate us when really you only have yourself to blame.
The course will be provided via a GPS file.  We will lightly mark some sections but know from past years that those markings may ""evaporate"" so you cannot rely on them.  For those of you racing, the Strava segments will be marked, hopefully.  The entire course is not a race, only those segments.  This encourages everyone to enjoy the event and party on, together.  It also discourages racing through intersections and traffic signals.  Obeying the rules of the road are important for safety and the future of the event.
Course maps and navigation files get emailed to participants just before the event and are not posted online.  We change it a little every year.  Sometimes we change it quite a bit!
This event is capped at whatever we're told until we prove to the towns that you'll ride through that we're not jerks.  Participants of previous years get a password to register early before registration opens to the public.  Sometimes this will sell out the event before it actually opens.
 
On My Darkest Days I Wear My Brightest Colors
    
 
April in New England can be a mixed bag of conditions.  It could be hot, cold, or wet.  It could be hot, cold, AND wet.  Who knows?  You'll need to dress for changing conditions.  For visibility on the road sections every participant is recommended to run a rear tail light for added safety.  We also recommend bright colored clothing.
 
Everybody's Looking For Something
   
 
This event isn't about the prizes, or the swag.  It's about the journey.  But dammit the prizes and swag are sweet too.
Here's how getting competitive works:  You have to run a GPS recording device capable of uploading to your Strava account through your phone when you finish.  We will not have computers for you to upload through because that did not work out in any year.  You can also run Strava on your phone.  Competitive riders have 5 hours to complete the course and upload and we post the results at 2:30pm.  There are 6 timed and marked segments, broken into three categories for awards.  Riders get their times of each category combined.  We award one male and one female winner of each category.  You can only win one category so in the event of someone sweeping all of them we award second place the prize.

Combination of timed road segments

I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For
 
Not convinced that this is for you?  Ask someone who's come before, but it might be sold out by the time you do.
Course maps and navigation files get emailed to participants just before the event and are not posted online.
 
For Those About To Rock We Salute You
 
This event is years in the making.  Hours of concept, arguing about the route, finding a venue, planning police details, town meetings, food, etc.  We do it for you, because we love you.  And we have to fight for it every single year.  Now get out there and crush this thing.
 
Refunds & Transfers
 
We're not jerks and we believe that a ""no refunds policy"" isn't a very encouraging thing to get you to commit to an event in advance.  So we give refunds up until 2 weeks before online registration closes, because that's plenty of time for someone else to take your place.  You just have to email us with a legit reason that isn't, ""I don't like the weather forecast"".  We also allow you to transfer your entry to another racer anytime up until online registration closes.  This costs an additional $5.
Refund requests less than two weeks out are denied.  At that point everything has been paid for and a refund directly impacts the charitable donation.

Farm event rules:
1. NO DOGS – Big, little, pure, mutt we love them all, but the only dogs allowed are the family farm dogs. THIS INCLUDES EVERYONE, NOT JUST CAMPERS. The Oesterlings are doing a wonderful thing by allowing people to come ride their private property, please respect this rule. 
2. No open fires. You can bring your portable grills or campfire rings but no open campfires. 
3. No pre-riding except during the weekly Wednesday night ride at the farm.
4. 
No smoking.
5. 
Kids supervised
 – You’re invited and encouraged to bring your entire family to our events as we do have much more than just a bike race going on with activities for everyone, even if it’s just relaxing by the pond or fishing in the creek. However, we require that children have adult supervision while on the farm at all times and you, as the parent or guardian, must provide this supervision. There are 2 ponds and there will be 
no lifeguard on duty
. 
Swimming is at your own risk.
RE: Kids in the pond – This is a big attraction for the youngsters and a great way for them to spend some time. However, 
please be aware that the boats and floating dock are the Oesterlings property and they must be treated with care. 
Abuse of these items or any other property will not be tolerated. Destruction of property will result in immediate ejection from the property.
6. Keep it quiet during quiet times. Quiet hours are 10pm – 7am. There will be plenty of time for you to be rowdy and loud cheering on the other racers. 
7. 
Don’t be a jerk.
8. 
Respect the property.
 For more than a decade now you’ve been pretty solid, which is why we keep inviting you all back. Please remember that the Oesterlings live here all year long, have been incredibly supportive of mountain biking and ‘cross racing on this property and are my in-laws! Please thank the Oesterlings for their hospitality whenever you have the chance. Bring Rosezelma flowers and Howdy some beer.
9. 
DO NOT LITTER
. I’m not just talking here about the camping area where we will have some trash receptacles, but do not drop your used gel packs on the course. I know you’re quite sure that those used foil containers are going to weigh you down and keep you from winning, but if you’re caught littering the course you’ll be DQ’d (and that don’t mean I’m taking you out for a BliZzard). Put that packet back in your jersey pocket or under your leg band ’til the end of the race. The only place you will be allowed to drop the food wrappers is at the start/finish line/feed zone area where they must be picked up by a teammate or your support person. DO NOT LITTER
10. 
Pack out what you pack in. 
Going along really well with #9 above. Bring a big ol’ trash bag, put your garbage in your big ol’ trash bag, put your big ol’ trash bag in your car, put your car in your driveway, and put your trash in your trashcan at home. Thanks for helping us keep the place clean. Helping us with little things like this keeps the event going because it keeps my crew, my folks, my outlaws, and my wife happy!
11. We reserve the right to create and impose further rules or do whatever else we want!
12. 
Parking – $5 per vehicle…carpool!

Jungle Habitat is a really special place to ride. If you don't know the history, the park was a Warner Brothers Safari Park until it was abandoned in the 70s. In 2007 the park was cleaned up and building of a trail network was started by JORBA (which continues to this day). Remenants of the old park still remain and perhaps decendants of the original safari animals? Either way the park will be a good challenge, and who knows, maybe you'll have enough in you to escape the jungle.

Race Loop Map & Elevation
By popular request, we'll be flipping the course direction from last year's edition.
We're in the process of finalizing the loop, but here's a good idea of loop length and elevation.
Long Loop 6.6 miles / 650 feet elevation
Short Loop 4 Mile / 400 feet elevation
 
We're working on keeping within H2H race time length guidelines as follows:
Cat 3/Jr 40-70 minutes -  Cat 2/Open 80-110 minutes - Cat 1/Pro 100-135 minutes
TCat 3 / Jrs to do 2 short loops that keep to the upper part of the park and will be less technical than the long course (though still will have some techy goodness).
Cat 2/Open will do 1 short loop  + 1 long loop
Cat 1/Pro will do 1 short loop + 2 long loops
Endurance - As Many Long Loops As You Can Do in 4 Hours
New Categories - Endurance 2.5 Hours

About: 
Track style points race where there is a sprint lap every 5 laps, riders who finish in the top 10 earn points, final sprint is worth 2x the points of the intermediate sprints. The overall winner is the rider with the most points accumulated at the conculsion of the race. Please see the event tech guide for full rules and omnium points allocation.  
Pulled/Lapped Rider Policy: Because of the difficult to score nature of a points race and the safety concerns of lead lap riders having to avoid lapped riders, the officials will be agressively pulling riders who are dropped and in danger of being lapped. If you are dropped and pose a danger to riders that are or will lap you then you will be pulled by the officials. It does not matter if it is your 3rd lap or there are only a couple laps to go. Your safety and other riders safety is our number one priority. You will keep any points you earned before being pulled. Please do not argue with the officials about their decision, their jobs are hard enough. If you find yourself about to be lapped before being pulled the best thing to do is to remain out of the way of passing riders as best as possible.

Family members, friends, and any other spectator also needs to supply this information
. If approved for access you will be able to check in with the guards at the gate, show them your identification, and be quickly granted access to the base on race day.

While we have a sweep vehicle, it is important to note that this ride doesn't offer any type of traditional SAG support. In fact, the sweep vehicle may not be able to reach all parts of the course. In these instances, if you need support, proceed to the nearest major thoroughfare on the route (which is either in front or behind you) and use every resource at your disposal, including calling Jonathan Brody, event co-director, at 
413-320-9259

2025 Registration Notes:
O
ur goal is to create fair and consistent competing race categories across distances and ages. Instead of selecting a predetermined distance age group, you’ll only need to select your race distance then Men, Women or Non-binary (unless you’re racing SS, Tandem, Fat Bike or Para-Athlete). We will create the final competing age group categories based on actual registration numbers, with a goal of keeping sizes reasonable yet competitive. Don't worry we'll have categories created and posted plenty early, so you have visibility into your race category competitors.
Race start waves, self-seeding:
In an effort to continue to improve course safety, rider interaction and overall race experience, we will once again let racers self-seed their start wave during the registration process.  Our goal is to create more consistency in start waves by having participants with similar speeds, competitiveness and anticipated pace going off in the same start wave. As part of the registration process, racers will “self-seed” themselves in the appropriate distance and race wave based on their 
expected finishing time
. During the registration process, you’ll answer a question regarding which start wave and expected finishing time you anticipate. Once a start wave has reached our maximum quantity, you’ll need to select the next available wave(sign up early for preferred wave). You will have the ability to change your own start wave selection, to another available start wave until the registration deadline on 3/28/25. *If you change your original registered race distance, you’ll need go into your new race distance and select a new start wave based on your new race distance*
Race wave start times:
The 100-mile race will still start ay 7am. The 36-mile will go off at 10am followed by the 62-mile at 11am and finally the 18-mile at 11:15am. Given the timeframe we have to conduct the race this time sequence is the best solution to minimize interaction between the different race distances and riders of varying speeds on the intermingling courses.
Key Dates:
 
Registration opens 11/9/24 at 9 AM EST.
Once the racer cap is met, open registration closes and the waitlist will open
Registration close 3/28/25 at 5PM EST. 
Distance changes, Race category changes and entry transfers…. close 3/28/25 at 5 PM EST. * No exceptions to this deadline

Let’s continue to encourage the next generation to race and experience what we love about cycling and gravel. All youth 18 and under will register and race the 18-mile & 36 - mile race distances for 
FREE - Courtesy of Grand Rapids Chair Co.
 We will also offer free registration for the 18-mile and 36-mile Youth Team Competitions, with the winning team receiving $1,000!!  See our website for details on the Youth Team Competition.

If your training didn't pan out as planned, you can change race distance or race category until the deadline on 3/28/25 at 5 PM EST.  There is a $10 charge for category changes. 
Waitlist Registration:
 
Once the race is “sold out”, the wait list for all categories will open. You will be “in line” for the next registration transfer based on the date and time you registered for the wait list. The 18, 36 and 62 mile categories roll up into one wait list and the 100 mile rolls up into its own wait list. 
PLEASE NOTE THE WAIT LIST IS AUTOMATIC. YOU WILL BE CHARGED AND ENTERED INTO THE RACE IF YOU ARE NEXT ON THE LIST TO RECEIVE A TRANSFER. IF YOU END UP NOT WANTING AN ENTRY, REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THE LIST.
 
Registration Transfers:
 
Did your plans change, and you’ll no longer be able to attend the race? Don’t worry, you have until 3/28/25 to sell your entry to the next person on the wait list (as long as there is someone on the wait list) or find your own replacement racer and sell them your race entry. 
The race registration transfer process
:
Sell your race entry to the next person on the waitlist
; 
Once the race is Sold Out the wait list for all categories will open. 
Simply go into your race registration through your Bikereg account or registration confirmation email and select “withdraw entry”. If there is someone on the waitlist they will receive your entry and you'll receive a refund to your original payment method.
Sell your entry to someone you find:
 
The original registered racer finds a person to sell their registration to and works out the selling price, payment arrangement and needs the buyers email address. The original registered racer then goes into their BikeReg race confirmation or account and selects “TRANSFER REGISTRATION”. Enter the email of the person buying your registration. The person transferring in gets an email, accepts the transfer, and goes to BikeReg and selects the category they will be racing in.  They will check out and pay the $10 transfer fee. 
**The event organizers reserve the right to delay, reschedule or cancel the race due to, but not limited to include; weather, emergencies and any unforeseen situations that may put at risk the safety of the racers, spectators, volunteers and general public.  No refunds or entry deferring will be provided, however the race organizers may offer registrants a partial refund or credit to a future race.

Our newest event in the Gravel Roll world is the Opelika Okey Dokey (say Ohkee-Dohkee).
Opelika means ""Big Swamp"" in the Creek language, and you'll ride past dozens of creeks and over bridges seemingly lost to time and space. But don't worry, there's none of the loose stuff here, just hard red dirt interspersed with a sprinkling of gravel across miles and miles of twisting and rolling terrain.
You'll ride through endless timberland and spooky hollows and be rewarded with occasional views of the Fall Line as it stretches across the landscape. Look closely and you may even discover another Appalachiosaurus hiding in plain sight in the road berms.
If you are looking to put some finishing touches on your Unbound training this is the perfect course. While Unbound will lack the curving roads, the short and recurring undulations of the Okey Dokey mimic much of what you will experience at Unbound.

- 
The 
Jailbreak 100
 mile route is a single loop of approximately 90% gravel roads and 10% pavement.  The course has a mild amount of small rollers with just under 3,000ft of climbing and is a fun and fast course.  We have a refuel & party stop at the halfway point where riders can send their own refuel supplies with a bag drop service. (Bag Drop is provided for all 100 miler riders.) and an additional aid station at mile 80.  We are returning to Iola High school for the starting/staging area, with the halfway party stop at the Bedias Fire Station. The Bedias aid station is easily accessible for family/friends/crew to cheer and support you. 
The 
Jailbird 55
 mile course starts the same as the 100 miler and turns off appx mile 45.  This route does NOT have bag drop service. There will be one aid station on the 55 mile course- 
early on at mile 20, please plan for 3 bottles or a hydration pack.
The 
Freewheel 20
 mile course follows the same route as the 100 and 55 milers.  It is quiet country roads and crosses over blacktop 3 times.  
-We are excited to join the Iola Community this year and participate in their annual Fish Fry Fundraiser at our finish line.  The food will be prepared 1 block over at the Iola Fire Station.  Riders will receive an extra large serving of fish, fries, hush puppies, beans, coleslaw, dessert and tea.  The food will be served from 12:30-6pm and is included for all the 55 and 100 mile riders.  (Spectators and 20 milers can purchase plates as well)  **To help the volunteers of the Iola Fish Fry plan quantities, please answer when you register if you plan to hang around the finish line and enjoy some delicious freshly prepared food!!

You are the spirit of the event.
The goal of the Eastern MO Rando is to be on a fully self supported, solo effort. No teams, no drafting, no supply cache, no support car.
The map is canon.
The course is fixed, the checkpoints are mandatory. You will only be counted as a finisher if you cover every bit of course correctly, and stop at each control point within the time frame. If you must detour off course, you must rejoin at the same place you left.
You are on your own ride.
You are responsible for your own maintenance, nutrition, and safety. You must be aware of and follow all safe riding principals. All commercially available resources are open to all riders.

200 Km Route and control points- 
https://ridewithgps.com/routes/44331618
Welcome to the Eastern MO Rando. Randonneuring has a long history of getting folks out on bikes and riding longer distances. This is not a road race, everyone that finishes within the allotted time will be a finisher. You can choose to ride 100 km with 1,000 m elevation or 200 km and 1,900 m gained on a fixed route. Each route does have small sections of light gravel: 4 Km on the 100 and 11 Km on the 200, but this event is designed for a road bike.
Each route will include a brevet card that lists the mandatory control points. Each control point you must stop, get your brevet card signed, and time written. These points are also the best opportunities to refuel for the next leg of the journey. Each control point will have a cut off time. You must stop at each one in time, and make it back to the finish.

is making a custom ride wallet exclusive for Eastern Mo Rando riders. The waterproof ride wallet will feature  US Made Silver Bullet EPX200 fabric and Eastern MO Rando woven logo patch.

There are two route choices (58 and 107 miles) that both start and finish in downtown Lenoir, NC and travel through the beautiful and rugged Wilson Creek Gorge.
The 58 mile route has approximately 4500 feet of climbing while the 107 mile route will take you up to the Blue Ridge Parkway and includes approximately 9700 feet of climbing.
Be sure to keep your head up and enjoy the scenery as the Bootlegger 100 takes you from historic downtown Lenoir and into the heart of the “other Pisgah,” also known as the Grandfather Ranger District.  Both the 107- and 58-mile options roll through the countryside before delivering you to a gravel wonderland with plenty of challenging terrain.  Just after you pass Coffey’s General Store and Museum, the two routes split, and the long course heads all the way up to the highest point of the day on the Blue Ridge Parkway.  Be prepared for gravity to do as much work for you as your braking fingers will let it as you descend fourteen miles down the Parkway and also Pineola Road before rejoining with the shorter course.  Everyone will enjoy a brief respite as the road parallels the burbling Wilson Creek for eight miles before the final gravel challenge on the infamous Maple Sally Road before heading back to town for the finish.
The course will be well marked in Pisgah Productions style and post-race meals and refreshments will be provided.

TESTAMONIALS:
‘My main takeaways, based on seven or eight serious gravel events, Battenkill, a few of the major fondos including Levi’s and Hincapie and nearly 100 USAC races  was 1) that the race was unusually well organized. 2) It is one of the most challenging “100” length gravel races in the country and maybe THE most challenging.’    -Jay P. 5/14/18
‘The ride/race itself you couldn’t ask for a better organized ride. All the turns were marked either with an arrow and or orange flagging tapping hanging from the trees before the turns and on stakes or hanging from the trees after the turn to assure you that you were still on course. They had 3 controls/rest stops on the 60 miler. The guy at the 41.7 one was way over the top cooking up grilled cheese sandwiches which for sure hit the spot. The burritos and beer at the finish line were great also.’     -Larry B. 4/24/18

The enjoyment of riding an amazing cycling route
2025 Course Description:
Nestled in the Bavarian Alpine village of 
Helen, GA
 the ride starts in the heart of the North Georgia Mountains.  After rolling out of Helen the route hits the first timed segment at mile 2.5, where any riders with intentions of an overall podium finish will need to put their cards on the table from the start. The first time section immediately enters the mountainous area made famous by the 2003-2008 
Tour de Georgia
. In 2008, Unicoi Gap was the second to last climb on the approach to the race-deciding ascent up 
Brasstown Bald
 where Kanstantin Suitsou got the jump on Trent Lowe and Levi Leipheimer to win the event.  As riders tackle this timed section they cover over 7 miles and climb 1500ft to the top of Unicoi Gap. The climb is very gradual for several miles, before turning into a real alpine ascent. Enjoy the vistas of the 
Chattahoochee National Forest
 on the descent before turning left and climbing up and over Jack’s Gap.
A left turn on Richard Russell Scenic Hwy will put riders face to face with the 2nd timed section, Hogpen gap. Within 6.5 miles and another 1500ft, riders will reach the highest point on the course at 3469ft with ramps of 12%.  The views at the top of the surrounding peaks are breathtaking. Check your speed and be careful on the descent as there are many sharp turns. Enjoy the ride through the forest knowing that the hardest riding is behind you.
After tackling the two biggest climbs of the day riders will head east from Helen through 
Unicoi State Park. 
The route then hits the 3rd timed section at mile 46, comprised of rolling terrain for a 4 mile section. Riders then get to enjoy a non-timed section of the route for the next 30 miles as the route explore the area round Lake Burton and Seed Lake.  Be sure to save a bit of energy for the final time section, it only last just over 2 miles but at over 80 miles in to the day you'll need to find some go go power.
The route finishes back into the landmark town of Helen where, in 1969, local business owners collaborated to create what is now called “Bavaria in the Appalachians.” Just outside of Helen on the route is the Nacoochee Indian Mound, the center of the ancient Cherokee town of Gauxule, visited by Desoto in his search for gold.  Be sure to plan to stick around for beers, food and music served up at the finish line.","Gran Fondo, Road Race",-83.7294546,34.7009043

A racer's or team's series score will be determined by adding their combined scores from individual races. You can race in 1 or all four events.  The more you race, the more points your can score for the series title.    A single DNF may not count against your standing, however multiple DNF’s may do so. Race Director has sole discretion when valuing points standings. Note that points are not shared between categories, so points scored in the 6-hour do not apply to the 3-hour, and vice versa.  In the case of a tie, the tie breaker will be determined by the racers total number of 1st place finishes, then 2nd place, then 3rd and onward if necessary. All scores are final after the race director reviews the scores and final race outcome is determined.

The BWR Festival 2025: The Biggest Cycling Bash in Southern California!
 
Get ready to immerse yourself in the ultimate endurance adventures as the Belgian Waffle Ride California (BWR CA) returns in 2025, more prominent, bolder, and more badass than ever! From April 25 to 27th, the Del Mar Polo Fields at Surf Sports Park will transform into a vibrant festival ground, celebrating all things cycling and running near the coast in San Diego. As the region's largest bike festival, The BWR Festival brings together a spirited community of riders, runners, exhibitors, and fun-seekers for a weekend that promises to thrill every attendee, whether you're a seasoned pro, a passionate amateur, or just here for the good vibes, waffles, and beer. With over a decade of redefining gravel racing under its belt, the BWR is not just a race—it's a cultural phenomenon. Here's what's on tap for this epic weekend:
 
Day 1: BWR Expo – Friday, April 25, 2025
 
The festivities kick off with The BWR Festival Expo, a buzzing marketplace of endurance bliss. Over 65 exhibitors will showcase the latest gear, gadgets, and apparel, setting the stage for an immersive experience. Wander through a vibrant array of booths featuring top brands, local artisans, and cutting-edge tech demos. Fuel up with a bite from the diverse food vendors, chill out with a brew at the Lost Abbey beer garden, and soak up the live music as you relax on the lush green polo fields. Whether you're gearing up for the weekend's challenges or simply soaking in the scene, the Expo is your all-access pass to the world of BWR. It's the perfect start to the ultimate cycling weekend, with something for every member of the family.
 
Day 2: Belgian Waffle Roadie-Oh & Belgian Waffle Run – Saturday, April 26, 2025
 
Saturday doubles the fun with two exciting new events that are sure to capture the imaginations of road cyclists and runners alike!
 
First up, the 
Belgian Waffle Roadie-Oh
, a Grand Fondo that invites road riders of all levels to join in on the fun. With three course options, there's a ride for everyone—from the die-hard racers hungry for competition to the laid-back riders out for a scenic challenge. Expect smooth tarmac, sweeping coastal canyon views, and all the camaraderie of a classic road ride with a distinctive BWR twist. Feeling extra brave? Take on the Dubbel Header challenge by racing the Roadie-Oh on Saturday and the legendary Waffle on Sunday. This event is your ticket to an unforgettable cycling experience on the roads of San Diego.
 
Belgian Waffle Roadie-Oh Distances:
 
100-miles (Century) - part of the BWR Dubbel Header; timed sectors
100 km (Metric Century) - a challenging and stunning route
50 km (31 miles) - an easier yet splendid roll-around
 
For those who prefer to hit the ground running, the Inaugural 
Belgian Waffle Run
 is your calling! This fast and fun 5,000-meter race winds through the beautiful grounds of the Del Mar Polo Fields, perfect for runners of all kinds. Whether chasing a personal best or donning your wackiest costume for a whimsical dash, the Belgian Waffle Run is about enjoying the fresh air, scenic routes, and great company. It's a race that celebrates the joy of movement, from the first step to the finish line, and invites everyone to join in the fun.
 
Day 3: The 14th Annual Belgian Waffle Ride – Sunday, April 27, 2025
 
The main event! The 14th Annual 
Belgian Waffle Ride
 is the weekend's crown jewel, and this year, it's ready to conquer the new coastal backdrop of Del Mar. Known as the ""most unique cycling event in the world,"" the BWR challenges riders with a grueling, gnarly course that fuses the best (and worst) of unroad terrains: from smooth pavement to rutted gravel, from sandy stretches to sinuous singletrack. Whether tackling the Waffle, Wafer, or Wanna options, you'll find yourself amidst a spirited field of gravelleurs, including world-class pros, local legends, and cycling enthusiasts. Each turn of the pedal pushes limits, ignites spirits, and promises a feast of Belgian waffles and Lost Abbey ales waiting at the finish line.
 
But BWR is more than just a race; it's a celebration of community, adventure, and the collective drive to give back. This year, we're racing to support Curebound, a San Diego-based nonprofit dedicated to funding life-saving cancer research. So, as you ride, run, or cheer from the sidelines with a beer in your hand, know that every effort and every dollar raised propels us closer to a cure.

With the stunning Del Mar Polo Fields as your backdrop, the BWR Festival isn't just a series of races; it's a full-throttle celebration of the spirit of adventure.
