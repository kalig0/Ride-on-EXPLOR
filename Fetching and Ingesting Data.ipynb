We believe that pretty much everyone is happier on a bike, whether riding or racing on the road, the moutain, on gravel, or snow -- it's all about the fun! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSTAGE 1 is composed of riders of all levels from all walks of life, from beginners to elite racers.

To join STAGE 1, please contact us first through our \\nFacebook page\\n, or drop by AirLine Cycles in East Hampton, CT, so we can talk with you, tell you more about our club, and learn more about you and your goals. Better yet, join us for a ride and lets talk more over pizza and a drink. No race resumes, no secret handshakes - just a good attitude and a desire to ride. If we're the right fit for you, welcome aboard!

MA\\nZip: 2747\\nLongitude: -70.9879928\\nLatitude: 41.6332267\\nDetails: http://www.BikeReg.com/themixtape\\nNotes: You Gotta Fight For Your Right to Party\\n \\nMeet The Mix Tape.  It's not a gravel ride.  It's not a road ride.  It's not a mountain bike ride.  It's not a gran fondo.  It's not a race.  Well it is a race... if you want it to be a race.  But you don't have to race.  But you can totally race.  So, it's kind of a gran fondo.\\nThe Mix Tape is our answer to the lack of something different down our way.  We wanted something that's as challenging as you want to make it with a little bit of everything.  Since we don't have many hills we had to get creative.  So we designed you a 50-60 mile rolling party that covers pavement, light trails, fire roads, a little singletrack, and some challenging tech that's brief but impactful.  What all of this means is that there's no perfect bike for this.  On the roads you'll hate your mountain bike and when you're climbing The Ledge you'll be wishing you had it.  So we feel that the perfect bike for this is the one with drop bars and the biggest tires that fit.  But you decide what works for you.  Just don't bring your road bike.  You won't get far and you will hate us when really you only have yourself to blame.\\nThe course will be provided via a GPS file.  We will lightly mark some sections but know from past years that those markings may \\\"evaporate\\\" so you cannot rely on them.  For those of you racing, the Strava segments will be marked, hopefully.  The entire course is not a race, only those segments.  This encourages everyone to enjoy the event and party on, together.  It also discourages racing through intersections and traffic signals.  Obeying the rules of the road are important for safety and the future of the event.\\nCourse maps and navigation files get emailed to participants just before the event and are not posted online.  We change it a little every year.  Sometimes we change it quite a bit!\\nThis event is capped at whatever we're told until we prove to the towns that you'll ride through that we're not jerks.  Participants of previous years get a password to register early before registration opens to the public.  Sometimes this will sell out the event before it actually opens.\\n \\nOn My Darkest Days I Wear My Brightest Colors\\n    \\n \\nApril in New England can be a mixed bag of conditions.  It could be hot, cold, or wet.  It could be hot, cold, AND wet.  Who knows?  You'll need to dress for changing conditions.  For visibility on the road sections every participant is recommended to run a rear tail light for added safety.  We also recommend bright colored clothing.\\n \\nEverybody's Looking For Something\\n   \\n \\nThis event isn't about the prizes, or the swag.  It's about the journey.  But dammit the prizes and swag are sweet too.\\nHere's how getting competitive works:  You have to run a GPS recording device capable of uploading to your Strava account through your phone when you finish.  We will not have computers for you to upload through because that did not work out in any year.  You can also run Strava on your phone.  Competitive riders have 5 hours to complete the course and upload and we post the results at 2:30pm.  There are 6 timed and marked segments, broken into three categories for awards.  Riders get their times of each category combined.  We award one male and one female winner of each category.  You can only win one category so in the event of someone sweeping all of them we award second place the prize.\\nROADIE ($200 Endurance Threads Gift Card):  \\nCombination of timed road segments\\nCLIMBER ($200 Endurance Threads Gift Card):  \\nCombination of timed off road climbing segments\\nSHREDDER ($200 Endurance Threads Gift Card):  \\nCombination of timed off road trail segments\\nMIX MASTER ($250 Cash):  \\nCombination of all timed segments\\n \\nI Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\n \\nNot convinced that this is for you?  Ask someone who's come before, but it might be sold out by the time you do.\\nCourse maps and navigation files get emailed to participants just before the event and

0:00\",\"Location\":\"443 Old Fall River

to Party\\n \\nMeet The Mix Tape.  It's not a gravel ride.  It's not a road ride.  It's not a mountain bike ride.  It's not a gran fondo.  It's not a race.  Well it is a race... if you want it to be a race.  But you don't have to race.  But you can totally race.  So, it's kind of a gran fondo.\\nThe Mix Tape is our answer to the lack of something different down our way.  We wanted something that's as challenging as you want to make it with a little bit of everything.  Since we don't have many hills we had to get creative.  So we designed you a 50-60 mile rolling party that covers pavement, light trails, fire roads, a little singletrack, and some challenging tech that's brief but impactful.  What all of this means is that there's no perfect bike for this.  On the roads you'll hate your mountain bike and when you're climbing The Ledge you'll be wishing you had it.  So we feel that the perfect bike for this is the one with drop bars and the biggest tires that fit.  But you decide what works for you.  Just don't bring your road bike.  You won't get far and you will hate us when really you only have yourself to blame.\\nThe course will be provided via a GPS file.  We will lightly mark some sections but know from past years that those markings may \\\"evaporate\\\" so you cannot rely on them.  For those of you racing, the Strava segments will be marked, hopefully.  The entire course is not a race, only those segments.  This encourages everyone to enjoy the event and party on, together.  It also discourages racing through intersections and traffic signals.  Obeying the rules of the road are important for safety and the future of the event.\\nCourse maps and navigation files get emailed to participants just before the event and are not posted online.  We change it a little every year.  Sometimes we change it quite a bit!\\nThis event is capped at whatever we're told until we prove to the towns that you'll ride through that we're not jerks.  Participants of previous years get a password to register early before registration opens to the public.  Sometimes this will sell out the event before it actually opens.\\n \\nOn My Darkest Days I Wear My Brightest Colors\\n    \\n \\nApril in New England can be a mixed bag of conditions.  It could be hot, cold, or wet.  It could be hot, cold, AND wet.  Who knows?  You'll need to dress for changing conditions.  For visibility on the road sections every participant is recommended to run a rear tail light for added safety.  We also recommend bright colored clothing.\\n \\nEverybody's Looking For Something\\n   \\n \\nThis event isn't about the prizes, or the swag.  It's about the journey.  But dammit the prizes and swag are sweet too.\\nHere's how getting competitive works:  You have to run a GPS recording device capable of uploading to your Strava account through your phone when you finish.  We will not have computers for you to upload through because that did not work out in any year.  You can also run Strava on your phone.  Competitive riders have 5 hours to complete the course and upload and we post the results at 2:30pm.  There are 6 timed and marked segments, broken into three categories for awards.  Riders get their times of each category combined.  We award one male and one female winner of each category.  You can only win one category so in the event of someone sweeping all of them we award second place the prize.\\nROADIE ($200 Endurance Threads Gift Card):  \\nCombination of timed road segments\\nCLIMBER ($200 Endurance Threads Gift Card):  \\nCombination of timed off road climbing segments\\nSHREDDER ($200 Endurance Threads Gift Card):  \\nCombination of timed off road trail segments\\nMIX MASTER ($250 Cash):  \\nCombination of all timed segments\\n \\nI Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\n \\nNot convinced that this is for you?  Ask someone who's come before, but it might be sold out by the time you do.\\nCourse maps and navigation files get emailed to participants just before the event and are not posted online.\\n \\nFor Those About To Rock We Salute You\\n \\nThis event is years in the making.  Hours of concept, arguing about the route,

Thats just how it goes. We make no claims or guarantees on snow conditions, and or trail conditions that are a direct result of snow temps. \\nWhy\\nThe first time I borrowed a fat bike and rode it down the local cross country ski trails in the snow, a whole new world was opened up! Trail riding was fun and I could stick with it all year ‘round. And, if I could get outside and get my heart rate up, I wouldn’t have to go to the boring old gym I told myself. We put on these races as a way to introduce new people to the world of fat bikes and create a community of riders!\\n \\nProceeds\\nWe are not a non-profit, but race proceeds will go towards keeping up with grooming some of our local trails, bringing fun events, and supporting new experiences. \\n \\nCommon Questions:\\nWhat kind of bike do I need to participate??\\n You must ride a fat bike at this event – 3.8\\\" or bigger tires. ·\\nWhat if I don’t own a fat bike?\\n Trail Labs will be offering their rental fleets to reserve all winter: visit, email, or call for rental options.\\nIs it timed? \\nThe races are indeed timed and results will be posted. Awards (no prizes, no cash) will be classy and cheap.\\nWhat is the race length? \\n  This will be a lap race with approximately 3-4 laps (10-12 miles) and feature the Meshach Browning Trail system. The exact course and the length of time you can expect to be out racing or riding will be based on conditions and weather on race week and race day.  \\nWhat if I am not the “racer” type? \\nNot a problem – feel free to enter anyway. Think of it as a chance to ride kick ass groomed trails with new friends! ·One lap, two, or three….no big deal. \\nWhat about the weather? \\nThis years races can happen in all weather. Chances are good for snow on these dates, but if there is no snow we may adjust courses as necessary. We are hardy Appalachians and will ride no matter the condition...unless it's just stupid out. Stay tuned to your email and social media as the event approaches. \\nSo how do I stay warm?\\n Dress appropriately in layers, ready for temps that can be below zero. Watch the weather. If your feet get too cold, walk. \\nWalk to the side of the groomed trails.\\n If you walk on the groomed trails it screws up the surface, so be respectful and walk off the edge! . Be prepared, I don't suffer fools. ·Need more info? Come to our clinic weekend on December 2, its free so there's no excuses. \\nWhat if I register but can’t ride??\\n We will miss you but, sorry, Registration fees are non-refundable.

Floyd County has tremendous dirt, primitive, and gravel road resources to allow riders to challenge themselves as much as they like. Floyd County; known as the \\\"Center of the Universe,\\\" has a special vibe which we know will foster a unique cycling experience for all of us the weekend of The Journey.\\nThe Format\\n: We have chosen to launch The Journey as a partner format event. Call it a race if you'd like, call it an experience if you will. The event will be professionally timed and podiums will be held. Duo racing is more common as a mountain bike stage race format at events like the Cape Epic or The Pioneer where partners coordinate as a team to go faster, farther, and harder than they would be able to as solo riders. The Duo format requires partnership and communication and produces a tremendously enriching experience for both participants. This comes from our belief that the best rides happen with friends. Fast or slow its all about The Journey.\\nRiders in a team compete side by side together with times taken at each checkpoint to ensure riders stay within 5 minutes of each other. Time for the team is taken a the second rider to cross the finish line. Riders are often faster together than they would be independently if they work together. Partners are encouraged to assist each other by any \\\"non-mechanical\\\" means. This means pushing, pulling, \\\"throws\\\" or other partner format assistance is acceptable but tethers, ropes, or other \\\"mechanical means\\\" are not permitted. \\nThe Journey will be 4 distances: 35,70, 100, and 149 miles with each featuring around 100 feet/mile of elevation. This year we feature NEW courses which move South to cover fresh ground towards Rocky Knob and Buffalo Mountain, circumnavigating The Buffalo and returning using Blue Ridge Parkway features. \\nPlease Note: Distances are subject to change pending permitting and conditions.\\nNEW distance, the County Traverse. This distance is limited to qualified teams who have what it takes to complete this unsupported gravel adventure. Lights and self-reliance required. There are multiple opportunities for resupply on course. This route circumnavigates Floyd County using majority dirt roads and unique features we couldnt get to without this length of route. Category is closed but wait list is opened. Register using the wait list and we will reach out to approve your participation in The County Traverse.\\nEach distance will have fully supported aid stations and medical along the route. We don't want a bonk or a bruise to get in the way of your Journey. \\nA note on finishing distances - Say you bit off more than you can chew.

The other 50% of the course will consist of mixed surfaces such as grass paths, gravel or pavement, and double\\\\u00A0track dirt roads.\\\\u00A0\\\\nThe \\\\\\\"Cross\\\\\\\" parts refers to the style of racing and variety of terrain the race combines with added elements of mountain biking and cyclocross. There may be barriers, stairs, or other obstacles that riders will have to navigate and as always, good vibes! The races are short, intense, and loads of fun!\\\\u00A0\\\\nWe have professional chip timing to get fast and reliable results! Beginners have 30 minutes to do as many laps as they can while the sport have 45 minutes and the experts have 60 minutes. We hold the tradition of letting people go out for the bonus lap if they make it in the timing zone before the clock hits 0! The winner is the person who does the most laps in the least amount of time.\\\\u00A0\\\\nTiming is being handled by Jeremy Ramsey with MMG Endurance Sports! \\\\nHe host's some great cycling events like the Buffalo River Gran Fondo, the Wormhole, SOTR, and other races so be sure to check them out and support! \\\\nhttps://www.mmgendurancesports.com/\\\\nThis race embodies the Norwegian proverb that says, \\\\\\\"There is no bad weather, only poor clothing choice.\\\\\\\"\\\\u00A0\\\\nWE RACE ANY WEATHER! \\\\nThat's what makes Mountain Cross what it is!

We are drawing heavily upon all the favorite races in New England, and aiming to have that sort of bike party\\\\u2026 thanks to the fine folks behind Ice Weasels, Secret Squirrel, and other great local races for the ideas and inspiration!\\\\n\\\\u00A0\\\\nIn the spirit of keeping things local, we are psyched to be sponsored by Massachusetts-based Endurance Threads for all the prizes! \\\\u00A0Endurance Threads will also be on hand to sell some merch as well, and we'll scrounge up some other great LOCAL prizes to reward your efforts. \\\\u00A0\\\\n\\\\u00A0\\\\nRACE\\\\u00A0DETAILS\\\\nBring yourself, your CX rig or mountain bike (no bar ends!), a FAT BIKE,\\\\u00A0and - of course - bring lots of\\\\u00A0friends to heckle you. We'll provide a great course, solid competition, fabulous prizes, bumpin' tunes, and (most of all) good times! See you there!\\\\n \\\\u00A0\\\\nJust a couple of things to note about the event:\\\\n1.\\\\u00A0 \\\\u00A0Please register in advance. We need to know how many port-o-potties to rent, how much food to bring, etc, and last minute registrations really make life hard for promoters\\\\u2026 and if you're one of those \\\\u201Cwait until the last possible second to register\\\\u2026and then complain about not enough port-o-potties\\\\u201D folks, please give that some careful reflection. \\\\u00A0 With that said, if you need to cancel your registration because of illness, family situation, etc, please just reach out and we'll be happy to move your registration to another event or provide a refund. \\\\u00A0\\\\u00A0\\\\n2. \\\\u00A0Hand-ups are allowed and encouraged. \\\\u00A0(don't know what a hand-up is? \\\\u00A0click here: \\\\nhttps://velorosacycling.com/blogs/news/the-art-of-the-handup\\\\n)\\\\n3.\\\\u00A0 Pre-riding the course will be allowed in between the races, but the course will not be accessible in the days before the event. \\\\u00A0Pre-riding during the active racing will NOT be allowed. \\\\u00A0\\\\u00A0\\\\n4.\\\\u00A0 This is a lower cost, unsanctioned race. \\\\u00A0Adjust your expectations accordingly. This event is all about winter fun on bikes! \\\\u00A0Yes, our prices went up from last year, but due to unpredictability of weather and registration, and the fact that we provide a ton of food each week, we thought this made sense. \\\\u00A0We aren't trying to make money off of this, so if in Week 3, we have a surplus, we'll pass it on to the community via cheap/free reg for some categories, prizes, or additional food. \\\\u00A0We'd rather be able to pay the plow guy than have to cancel a race if we get some snow.\\\\n5. \\\\u00A0Podiums in the A, B, Fat Bike, and Junior races will have separate podiums for men and women.\\\\n6. \\\\u00A0Individual races: $35 adults, $30 juniors. \\\\u00A0Series pass: $90 adults, $75 juniors\\\\u00A0\\\\nRace in a second category for only $10 (Additional Series Pass: $25)\\\\u00A0\\\\n(if you should be an A, please don't sandbag and race in the B's or we will heckle you mercilessly and make you race on a klunker)\\\\n7\\\\n. \\\\nRace dates: January 12, January 26, and February 9th\\\\nIf weather is dangerous, we will choose an alternate date.\\\\u00A0\\\\n8. \\\\u00A0Non-binary athletes are warmly welcomed. \\\\u00A0If you love to ride and race bikes, that's all we need to know, and we'd love to have you take part in our race.
